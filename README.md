# What Is This
---
PDFManager is a program made by Broward Health's Local Friendly IT Team(Field Services FTW) to help with the basic needs of working with PDF files.

It is meant to merge PDFs, remove pages from PDFs, rotate pages within PDFs, append a screenshot (PNG Image Specifically), and add already existing PDF pages to duplicate or take from one PDF to put in another one.

It _DOES NOT_ create brand new PDF pages or alter content within a PDF page. There might be other things possibly expected, but unless it is on the above list, it is unknown if that functionality will ever be supported.

If you run into any issues using the program, have suggestions to improve it, or have anything else relevant regarding this program, please let me know and I will try and take a look to fix it.

### 1. Merge Tab
> Select this tab to open the Merge Tab if it is not already open
### 2. PDF Name/File Path
> Displays the file path of any PDFs you open.
> PDFs will be merged in order from the topmost open PDF to the lowest open row. Rows can be skipped without issue.
### 3. PDF Page Selection
> You can select which pages you want to display for the PDF on the same row, how many times to display a page, and in what order you want to display the pages.
> You can input a _range_ of pages in the format of _FirstPage-LastPage_, where _FirstPage_ is a smaller number than _LastPage_.
> You can also chain multiple _ranges_ together by separating the ranges by a comma, _FirstPageRange1-LastPageRange1,FirstPageRange2-LastPageRange2_.
#### Range Examples 
| Example Input | Pages Displayed                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 1-4           | 1,2,3,4                                     |
| 5-6           | 5,6                                         |
| 3-1           | Will Not Display   |
| 1-2-3         | Will Only Display Pages 1, 2 (Just do 1-3)  |
| 1-2,4-6       | 1, 2, 4, 5, 6                                  |
> You can also input individual pages by inputting the page followed by a comma, _Page1, Page2, Page3_. This needs to be in the the order you want the pages to appear. If you put the same page down multiple times, it will display multiple times as well.
#### Individual Page Examples
| Example Input | Pages Displayed |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| 1,3,5         | 1, 3, 5         |
| 2, 4          | 2, 4            |
| 5, 1,2        | 5, 1, 2         |
